# University of WarwicK
# Read the following file carefully!

#############
# You will find two folders in this archive, one for a database container and one for a webserver container.
# This README file provides you with the commands to get the web application working in the state it is currently deployed at our fictional client.
# In all of the config files replace u1234567 with your specific university ID before you do the demo.
############

## Background
# You have been emailed the following emvironment as is, turns out, that for deployment the client uses Makefile -s to somewhat automate their Operations Processes. 
# To be able to test the system as it is exactly on their production servers, you have been given the following instructions by a user named 1337dev0Ps1N7ErN from the company:

####### DATABASE ###########

# First build the database image from the supplied makefile, just by entering the command: 
make
#Then run the container with
make run
# After running this command, your mysql container will be configured with our database.
# There are some handy clean up scipts for you already provided
make clean

####### WEBSERVER ###########

# First build the webserver image from the supplied makefile, just by entering the command: 
make
#Then run the container with
make run
# You should now be able to browse to http://localhost/ to view the web application!

# There are some handy clean up scipts for you already provided
make clean

# NOTE: If you have issues getting the basic setup working, ask for help!

# Additional NOTE 1: There should be no space between "-p" and your password (for example -ptest )
# Additional NOTE 2: You will receive a MYSQL error if you attempt to run the 'docker exec' command too quickly after starting the database container with 'docker run'. Wait for a few seconds so that database can get started.
# HINT: Importing your database everytime you start the container is not efficient... Think how you can make this data persist!
